{#
    This query calculates the unique active addresses on a specified chain ('origin_key') over the last 7 days.
    The metric (cca_last7d_exclusive) is computed as (unique address on chain MINUS intersecting unique addresses).
    
    metric_key: cca_last7d_exclusive

    Parameters:
    - origin_key: The key identifying the target chain.
    - days: default = 7; The time interval (in days) over which to consider active addresses.
